# Overview

The script will attempt to create a dungeon, step by step, going through the dungeon's history.
It could start as the empty passages left by the flow of magma, or a tin-mine.

After that, a civilization establishes itself, traps can be made, and finally, a nasty bad-guy faction invades, populating the place with nasty things.

## Example

We start with randomly shifting rooms, then add features:

- a chasm
- river
- maybe a lake
- fungus growing around any water

Then some civilizing society (dwarves/ gnomes) comes in, digs out rooms and:

- makes the fungus into a proper fungal garden,
- creates living quarters,
- maybe a library,
- probably works of art.
- and traps the entrance.

Finally, tragedy arrives as a horde of monsters take over.
Suppose a necromancer comes along:

- dwarves become undead dwarves
- some traps no longer work
- the fungal garden becomes overrun by oozes

The computer then makes a description of each room, along with a very simple plot hook.

> You hear of an evil necromancer, inhabiting an old dwarven stronghold.
